class PRPAllpairRanker(Ranker):
    """
    Paper-aligned PRP-Allpair (Qin et al. 2024).

    - Uses PRP pairwise comparisons as in §3.1–3.2.
    - For each unordered pair (i, j), calls the oracle twice:
        * lt(i, j): True if i should be AFTER j.
        * lt(j, i): True if j should be AFTER i.
      and aggregates wins / ties into per-document scores.
    - Score(i) = (#wins + 0.5 * #ties) over all j != i.
      Normalization by (n-1) is omitted since it does not affect ranking.
    - Final ranking: sort by descending score, with ties broken by
      the initial index (BM25 order), i.e., BM25 is used to resolve
      prediction conflicts or failures, as in the paper.
